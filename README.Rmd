# My R package bundle

This package streamlines installation of my favorite R packages.

```r
# Use remotes package to install: install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("EricEdwardBryant/bundle.eeb")
```

# What packages are in the bundle?

With `bundle.eeb` built on `r Sys.Date()`, and with the following sytem
configuration:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
rprofile::rprofile(TRUE)
```

The following packages will be installed:

- **Imports:** directly required packages.
- **Remotes:** packages installed from a non-CRAN like repository.
- **Downstream:** packages required by *Imports*.

```{r comment = ""}
bundle.eeb::bundle()
```
